# AI-Chatbot
 A retrieval based chatbot using NLTK, Keras, Tensorflow, Python, etc.
 Details of the file structure: 
 Intents.json – The data file which has predefined patterns and responses.
 
 train_chatbot.py – In this Python file, we wrote a script to build the model and train our chatbot.
 
 Words.pkl – This is a pickle file in which we store the words Python object that contains a list of our vocabulary.
 
 Classes.pkl – The classes pickle file contains the list of categories.
 Chatbot_model.h5 – This is the trained model that contains information about the model and has weights of the neurons.
 Chatgui.py – This is the Python script in which we implemented GUI for our chatbot. Users can easily interact with the bot.
 
-> Here are the 5 steps to create a chatbot in Python from scratch:
1. Import and load the data file
2. Preprocess data
3. Create training and testing data
4. Build the model
5. Predict the response

The program will open up a GUI window within a few seconds. With the GUI you can easily chat with the bot.
